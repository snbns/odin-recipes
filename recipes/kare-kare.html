<h2>A delicious peanut butter based beef or oxtail stew, with vegetables</h2>

<br>

<p>
    This amazing Filipino dish is commonly made with oxtail, and can be substituted with beef, or can even be made with both. 
    The base is made with peanut butter, with the broth that comes from cooking the meat.
    When the meat is combined with the peanut butter base, you have a delicious combination of a bit of sweet with savory.
    Topped with various vegetables for some added color and crunch, optional side of shrimp paste, this will quickly be one of your favorites.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1lb Oxtail or Beef</li>
    <li>24oz Peanut butter</li>
    <li>Vegetables of your choosing (suggested: eggplant, string beans)</li>
    <li>Shrimp paste</li>
    <li>Salt, pepper</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Place oxtail or beef in a large pot with water. Make sure meat is completely submerged. Add a bit of salt/pepper.</li>
    <li>Wait for water to completely boil with the meat, and then turn down the heat to medium-low and let sit for about 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove any floating particles from the water after the meat is done cooking.</li>
    <li>Remove about a quarter of the water from the pot. Turn up the heat back to medium-high and start adding your peanut butter.</li>
    <li>Add peanut butter to taste. You'll want the consistency to be a bit thick. Some people like to use creamy or crunchy peanut butter - it's up to you.</li>
    <li>Add shrimp paste to taste.</li>
    <li>Keep mixing while you add the peanut butter. Once you get it to the consistency and taste you like, add in the vegetables and cover the pot to let the vegetables cook.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
